# The Movie Listings
This is a Movie Listing project using React Hook. The project as of Jan 2019 makes use of Create React App @ 16.7.0-alpha.2 so it's not supposed to be used in any production application and was developed for a bit of fun.

This solution uses Google's WorkBox service worker (SW) for a PWA. The SW overriding the Create-React-App service worker using a config-override.js during the compiling process. THE SERVICE WORKER WILL ONLY CACHE AS BUILD. So, for example:
<p><code>localhost:5000</code></p>
rather than the usual dev address:
<p><code>localhost:3000</code></p> 
for a Create-React-App setup.
