# The Movie Listings
This is a Movie Listing project using React Hook. The project as of Jan 2019 makes use of Create React App @ 16.7.0-alpha.2 so it's not supposed to be used in any production application and was developed for a bit of fun.

This solution uses Google's WorkBox service work for PWA capabilities by overriding the OOTB Create-React-App service worker using a config-override.js during compiling process.
